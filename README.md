NLSExploreGeoreferencedMapsOL3
==============================

This <a href="http://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/NLSExploreGeoreferencedMapsOL3/index.html">demonstration application</a> uses <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers v 3.5</a>, a <a href="http://blog.seiyria.com/bootstrap-slider/">Boostrap / JQuery</a> transparency slider and three sample <a href="http://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaics to form a viewer for historical georeferenced map mosaics. Searching is possible by zooming in on the map, with an option to change the map base layer between OpenStreetMap, MapBox and Bing layers. Searching is also possible by using a Nominatim gazetteer, a British National Grid Reference, as well as historic county and parish drop-down lists. 

<a href="http://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/NLSExploreGeoreferencedMapsOL3/index.html">This application</a> was originally developed by <a href="http://www.klokantech.com/">Klokan Technologies GmbH</a> for the <a href="http://www.nls.uk">National Library of Scotland<a> in 2011. Following discussion in 2014, the application was released as open-source, ON CONDITION THAT IT IS NOT DEVELOPED AS A REPLACEMENT OR ALTERNATIVE TO VIEWING THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND'S MAPS. We hope that other libraries, archives and institutions may benefit from the code in making available their geographical collections.
